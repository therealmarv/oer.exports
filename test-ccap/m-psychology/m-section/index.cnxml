      Sexism is prejudice toward an individual based on his or her gender. Typically sexism takes the form of men holding biases against women, but women can also show sexism toward women and men. Like racism, sexism may be subtle and difficult to detect. Common forms of sexism in modern society include gender role expectations, such as expecting women to be the caretakers of the household. Sexism also includes people?s expectations for how members of a gender group should behave. For example, women are expected to be friendly, passive, and nurturing and when women behave in an unfriendly, assertive, or neglectful manner they often are disliked for violating their gender role (Rudman, 1998). Sexism can exist on a societal level such as in hiring, employment opportunities, and education. Women are less likely to be hired or promoted in male-dominated professions such as engineering, aviation, and construction. Have you ever experienced or witnessed sexism? Think about your household chores. Do the females in the house cook the meals and wash the dishes? Do the males in the house take out the trash and mow the lawn? Why do you think there are differences in how men and women perform household chores?

Although these secondary characteristics are important in forming a first impression of a stranger, the social categories of race, gender, and age provide a wealth of information about an individual.
